NOTE : system("pause") it is not important you can remove it 
Note : The explaination of the problems not by the  order .

### Explaination about these problems :



###### A-Say Hello with c++\\



I made an application that print hello to anything I want

###### B-Basic data tybes\\

I made an application , I input some variable from different data tybes at the same line and then I made the output each variable at single line by using ("\n")



###### C-Simble calculator \\



I made a simble calculator which do three operations only multiblication summation and subtract  



###### D-Differnce\\



I made this app to solve a specific eqution which I specify 



###### E-Area of circle \\



I made an application which calculate the area of the circle 

###### F-Digits summation\\

I made an application that made the user to know if the two numbers which you input are multiplies or not by experiment the two numbers by the reminder 

EX. n=12,b=22

hint 2+2

answer=4
 

###### G-Summation from 1 to n\\

I made an application that give me the summation of the numbers from 1 to N by using summation law (segma)

###### H-Two numders \\

I made  app that give me the floor , ciel and round of variable int 

I use package (#include<cmath>)

###### I-Welcome for you with conditions //

I made an application that take two numbers from the user if the first number  more than or equal the second number print "yes" else print "no" d I use in it short hand if else

###### L- Brothers //

I made an application that show if the two person is brother or not and it's by comparing the second name of the first person and the second named of the second person

###### M-Capital or Small or Digit //

I made an application that takes from the user a character and I told him if it digit or alpha and if it alpha I told him if it small or capital 

######## N-Char //

I made an application that transfer the letters from the upper case to lower and vise versa

######## O-Calculator //

I made a calculator for th basic operation but in different way the user input the whole operation like this (3+2) and I show the result only for you 

########## Q. Coordinates of a Point //

I made an application that give the user the quarant of the point lie in by using if condition 


########## R. Age in Days //

I made an application that takes from the user the age by daus an the application give the age wiyh years , days an months 


************** Problems (V _ W _ Y _ Z _ T ) this problems explain itself

##########  U. Float or int //

This problem wants from me to show if the number which the user integer or float if it integer I print  it's integer and print the integer part if it float I print it's float and print the integer part then the float part I use casting in it to ease the solution

######## X. Two intervals //

This problem wants from me to found the intersection of the interval 


The intersection of the intervals 

We calculate the the max value of the starting point and then calculate the min of the end 

If the max smaller  than or equal min then the intersection is the max value and the min value  

If no intersection print -1

Example 1. *First Example (1 15 5 27)*:
   - max_start = max(1,5) = 5
   - min_end = min(15,27) = 15
   - 5 ≤ 15 → intersection exists: "5 15"

Max min : #include < algorithm > 


########### S. Interval //

The problem wants from me to reach the intervals which the program specify
