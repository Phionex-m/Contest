### Explaination about these problems :



###### A-Say Hello with c++\\



I made an application that print hello to anything I want

B-Basic data tybes\\

I made an application , I input some variable from different data tybes at the same line and then I made the output each variable at single line by using ("\\n")



###### C-Simble calculator \\



I made a simble calculator which addition,sum,multiblication two number which I entered 



###### D-Differnce\\



I made this app to solve a specific eqution which I entered and I entered four numbers which solve the equation 



###### E-Area of circle \\



I made a static application which calculate the area of the circle 

F-Digits summation\\

I made a static app that give the sum of the last numbers of two numders 

EX. n=12,b=22

hint 2+2

answer=4

I use the reminder to separate the two numbers to take the summation of the last two numbers 



###### G-Summation from 1 to n\\



I made an static app that give me the factorial of n number 

I used If conditional to do it 



###### H-Two numders \\



I made static app that give me the floor , ciel and round of variable int 

I use package (#include<cmath>)
